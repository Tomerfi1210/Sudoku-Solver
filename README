Algorithm

Starting with an incomplete board:

1.Find some empty space
2.Attempt to place the digits 1-9 in that space
3.Check if that digit is valid in the current spot based on the current board
 a. If the digit is valid, recursively attempt to fill the board using steps 1-3.
b. If it is not valid, reset the square you just filled and go back to the previous step.
4.Once the board is full by the definition of this algorithm we have found a solution.

In Solver folder we solve the sudoku using backtracking. if we run the program the sudoku will be solved.

In GUI folder we use Pygame to give the user a chance to play. the gui part using the solver file to know if the user did right or wrong.
